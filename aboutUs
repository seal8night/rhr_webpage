If you haven't discovered it yet, our programming consists of great Bible study teaching programs, praise and worship, and contemporary Christian music that glorifies the God of all creation. The purpose for our existence is two-fold.
<ul>
 	<li>First, to reach our growing number of listeners with the Gospel (Good News) message that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is Savior and Lord, and that the only way to receive eternal life is through Him alone (Matthew 28:19-20; John 14:6).</li>
 	<li>Second, to provide a resource to Christians to help them grow in their relationship with the True and Living God, and to strengthen them for daily, holy living as members of the body of Christ (Ephesians 4:11-16).</li>
</ul>
Our goal is to provide high quality programming the best way we can with what the Lord provides to us.
In His Love,
KKRH Staff
